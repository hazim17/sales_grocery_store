# Sales Grocery Store

Measuring business performance in a company is very important to track, monitor, and evaluate the success, failure, and progress of various business processes. In this project, we will see the sales, profit, and orders quarterly. Also, we can see how the customer churns with the sales generated. Then we will see which category product gives more sales and orders. And where most of the customer's states are located.

Based on the dashboard above We can see that around 48% of customers are churned, but Customers who are not Churned still provide greater Revenue than Churned ones.
Churned customers tend to order 1-2 times, while those who don't churn tend to order more than 2 times. Churn customers buy the most products in the eBooks, Training Videos, and Blueprints categories. Even though the eBooks and Training Videos category products have the most orders, they are not as big as the Revenue generated. Product categories that generate the most revenue are Drones and Robots, followed by Drones kits and Robots kits. The product category that generates the least revenue is Blueprints. The customer mostly comes from California, Texas, and Florida, and the states with the largest Churn are also California, Texas, and Florida.
